My Reflection:
I thought this assignment was very fun. It was cool to see a few simple lines of code turn into a full image. For certain parts of my code, I had to use a trial-and-error method. For example, I wanted my turtle to draw a sun by first relocating to a new location. Since I wasn't sure what the exact coordinates of the location were, I had to input random coordinates and adjust them accordingly. Overall, it was an interesting exercise, and it was fun to mess around with the different functions of Trinket.
