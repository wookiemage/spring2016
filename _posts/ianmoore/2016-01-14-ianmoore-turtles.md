This is the first program I'm embedding:

And this is the second:

The above programs were relatively straightforward to build. The second, obviously, pulls heavily from the first. It just has a sad story on top of it. I faced some issues creating punctuation with the ```print``` command, particularly on line 83: ```print "I made this flower for you,", tina_yourname,"."```. This command creates a space between the value entered for tina_yourname and the period, which is obviously not grammatically correct. Whoops!
