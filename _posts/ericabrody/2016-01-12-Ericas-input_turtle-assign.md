Reflections
I got stuck on the raw_input program initially, because it took me a while to figure out that when the color was a variable, it 
didn't need quotes around it.

For the turtle program, I wanted to play with color. Initially, I tried to create a small square and fill it in and then make a bigger 
square on top. However, the fill color of the bigger square covered up the small square. So I figured out that it would be better to draw 
the biggest square first and then draw smaller squares on top of it. One remaining question, I couldn't figure out why the edges
of the squares aren't showing when the square is first drawn, we just see the fill.
