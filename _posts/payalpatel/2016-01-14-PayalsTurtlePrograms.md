Reflection:
I found these two exercises to be interesting and challenging, particularly the "Turtlehacking" exercise.  While working on these programs I realized programming can involve a lot of trial & error.  With the Turtlehacking exercise I found myself hitting a roadblock right from the start.  I couldn't decide what to create.  As I was brainstorming, I startred creating four different squares in one big square.  Once I created the four squares I got the idea to put a different design in each square.  In order to do this I looked at some sources online.  I borrowed some code from [this site] (https://michael0x2a.com/blog/turtle-examples) to help with the initial design found in the purple square.  I also used [this site] (http://codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Sample-Term4-lesson01.pdf) to better understand for loops and range functions (which helped me create the other designs found in my turtle program).
